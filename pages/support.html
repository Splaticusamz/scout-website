      <p>Need help with Boring Wealth? We're here for you.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>Boring Wealth is an AI-powered app that helps you discover and research business opportunities by turning idle scrolling time into productive deal flow research. Swipe through curated case studies, save the ones that interest you, and build conviction on your next venture.</p>

      <h2>Common Questions</h2>
      
      <h3>How does the AI discovery feed work?</h3>
      <p>Our system automatically scans trusted sources like Indie Hackers, Starter Story, podcasts, and Reddit daily. AI filters the content to surface only high-quality case studies with real numbers and compelling hooks.</p>

      <h3>Can I add my own case studies?</h3>
      <p>Yes! While the app provides daily AI-curated content, you can also manually add any business or opportunity you discover elsewhere.</p>

      <h3>How does the scoring system work?</h3>
      <p>Each business is evaluated against seven weighted criteria tailored to your goals: capital required, skill fit, market size, remote-friendliness, time to revenue, competition level, and scalability potential.</p>

      <h3>Is my data private?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. Your research, saved case studies, and scoring criteria are private to you and any collaborators you explicitly invite. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>
